We set out to analyse the set of uniquely expressed, silenced and differentiated genes between the Haploid/Diploid gametophyte and the sporophyte. We performed functional annotation with EnTAP, and then visualised the genes in networks created by StringDB.

## Process

1. Gathered gene IDs from the lists of DE genes and uniquely silenced genes
2. Ran EnTAP against Physcomitrium patens and Arabidopsis thaliana
3. Used the gene IDs from the output of EnTAP as an input to the StringDB.
