Repeat analysis of Funaria genome to identify LTRs (gypsy, copia, helitron, and unknown) and positions. 

1) Repeat modeler. Directory: /archive/projects/EBP/Funaria_repeats/repeatmodeler
2) GFF3 used Directory: /archive/projects/EBP/Funaria_repeats/repeatmodeler/Funaria_Genome_Scaffold_mask/Funaria_26scaffolds_LTR.gff which is the repeatmodeler output trimmed to only 26 scaffolds. 
3) Used bedtools sliding window default (1000 bp in either direction) to assess where genes are relative to repeat regions. 

Sliding window results for 1kb up and downstream of LTRS
