# Funaria vs Arabi functional analysis

### Process

1. Using ENTAP, and Arabidopsis as the database, we generated the functional annotation for the Funaria genes.
2. We had a list of gene IDs which were up/downregulated, or are specific to a certain stage of the Funaria (HG- haplopid gametophyte, DG- diploid gametophyte, and S- sporophyte)
3. We assessed whether there were any significantly enriched pathways/processes in each of the categories. We manipulated the text files to suit the format for input into StringDB.
